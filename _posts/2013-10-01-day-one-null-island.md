I could never write a diary. But when I came across [OSM's Diaries](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/geografa/diary), it gave me the idea to keep track of my OSM edits, runs, and everyday things I think of related to maps. It's a way of keeping time and just making memories. I'll see how it goes.

A note about this site. This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Javascript Libraries. All the code is in [Github](https://github.com/geografa/scavengeo/tree/gh-pages) and served by Github Pages. Love to hear your thoughts so drop me a line on the [Twittersphere](http://twitter.com/geografa) if you can.
