I can't go a mile along I-84 without gawking out the window wondering what beautiful runs lie along the majestic Columbia River. One area in particular, [Hamilton Island](http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/hamilton_island.html), panned out to be fun little map I made for the [Columbia River Orienteering Club](http://croc.org) (CROC). It sits just below the Bonneville Dam, a remnant of the spoils of progress but now a refuge for wildlife and nature lovers. Last Saturday, was CROC's [last race of the year](http://croc.org/content/hamilton-island-1) so drove out to the Gorge for nice little run.

### The Marshy Mountain
Weather was what you'd expect mid-November - cold, sideways rain, wind that cut deep. But it didn't stop the 50 or so participants for taking a stroll or running their lungs out over this small marshy mountain. One woman described the terrain best - "hummocky". The island is a former superfund site, filled with who-knows-what from the Bonneville Dam construction. Water seems to pump out the top making these odd pockets of marshy land and rivulets that work there way down the slopes. Running on the hill can be treacherous but visibility is good. 

### The Paper Map

I started the map about 4 years ago after I couldn't stand the temptation of knowing what was on that island. It turned out it was fairly well used by fishers and hikers just out for stroll. When I figured it was public land and I got the AOK from ACOE, I grabbed some [LiDAR](http://www.opentopography.org/), some NAIP imagery and went to town on [OCAD](http://ocad.com/en/). A few visits later, I had decent map that's holding up to this day.

### The Digital Map
I recorded my tracks using [Strava](http://www.strava.com/), my GPS app du jour. I exported the route to GPX, loaded it into [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) and grabbed the GeoJSON for use with the [MapBox.js API](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v1.4.2/).

The paper map was scanned and georeferenced in [QGIS](http://qgis.org). Tiles were finally made from the georeferenced map in [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) and uploaded to MapBox. The pace of the moving marker is not my actual pace. But because I have my splits, I may play with breaking up the track into segments and then timing each accordingly.

### The Run

CROC now uses [SportIdent](http://www.sportident.com/index.php?lang=en), an RFID logger for recording control visits and splits. It's a treat to get a print out of your splits at the end of the race and compare runs with other racers on your course.
My run was more of a series of intervals - walk or jog up hills, run down slopes, and slow jog trails. Not the most exciting run for my out-of-shape legs and lungs. Luckily, Brian Hauck, the meet director, was forgiving and didn't run us over the hill too many times.

All in all, it was great to get back on the map in familiar territory. The orienteering season is over for now but I'm looking forward to some winter mapping of new areas along the Gorge and beyond.
