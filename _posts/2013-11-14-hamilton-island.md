I can't go a mile without gawking out the window wondering what beautiful runs lie along the majestic Columbia River. One area in particular, panned out to be fun little map I made for the Columbia River Orienteering Club (CROC) - Hamilton Island. It sits just below the Bonneville Dam, a remnant of the spoils of progress but now a refuge for wildlife and nature lovers. This Saturday, I'm headed out for CROC's [last race of the year](http://croc.org/content/hamilton-island-1). If you can make it out, I would highly suggest it because not only is it a fun run, it's FREE.
