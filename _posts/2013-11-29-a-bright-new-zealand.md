I find myself looking at New Zealand as of late with my [sister](http://gutierrezable.wordpress.com/) abroad in Wellington. It's a good excuse to make some new maps, so naturally, I chose to get the [OSM Bright](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/) sample up and running again. 

### OSM Bright
For those of you who don't know about [OSM Bright](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/), it's a full-featured bootstrapped [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) project for styling OSM data. There are some tricks to getting started but following the [OSM Bright Quickstart](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/) step by step will get you where you need to go. Working with the sample can be a large undertaking but I'm just starting small with a focus on text and playing around with simple styles. I also grabbed a hillshade from [NASA](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) and georeferenced it to give it some depth but it's a bit too coarse to display well.

It's a good start and fun data to play around with. Hopefully, I can get over to Wellington and do some on-the-ground-mapping.
