This is a run route in my old hood. I like the idea of maximizing my feet on soft ground so I make it a point to loop around parks as much as possible. Woodlawn Park is a small park nestled in the North Portland neighborhood of Woodlawn. It's always eerily quiet there. Peninsula, on the other hand, is always busy but it has just about every amenity a park can have. Circling the Rose Garden is a real treat and worth the stop.
