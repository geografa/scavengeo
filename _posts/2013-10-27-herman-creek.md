This amazing little gem is one of my favorite places in the Columbia River Gorge. I think it's part of Cascade Locks property but it's unlcear. No signs, just a gate and a rough parking lot. The peninsula looks like a one time big hunk of rock that's been quarried extensively. It's a small place so easy enough to hike around in an hour. The cliffs are stunning with the Gorge as the backdrop. I hope to map this out for an orienteering sprint map one day. Below are my tracks along the trails and vistas.
